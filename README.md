# California-Grants-Data-Analysis
The Grant Information Act of 2018 of California requires the California State Library to build a regularly updating online database for grant opportunities. Grantseekers can glean information on grant or loan opportunities, including information about how to apply. I use Jupyter notebook to ask a few questions:   What are the total sums available for each government agency?   Which projects per agency have the most applications submitted?
