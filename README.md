# California-Grants-Data-Analysis
The Grant Information Act of 2018 of California requires the California State Library to build a regularly updating online database for grant opportunities. Grantseekers can glean information on grant or loan opportunities, including information about how to apply. I use Python Pandas in a Jupyter notebook to ask a few questions:   

1. What are the total sums of estimated available funds for projects per agency?  
2. Which agency has the most applications submitted?
